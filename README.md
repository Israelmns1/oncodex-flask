## Overview

Oncodex Flask is a lightweight web application built with Flask. It allows users to upload CSV files, preview the data in a tabular format, and visualize the data using Pandas and Matplotlib. This project serves as the final submission for the CS50x course, showcasing practical skills in web development and data analysis.

## Features

- **CSV Upload**: Easily upload CSV files through a user-friendly interface.
- **Tabular Preview**: View your data in a clean, organized table.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate basic visualizations using Matplotlib.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Lightweight**: Fast and efficient, designed for ease of use.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A micro web framework for Python.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web application.
- **JavaScript**: For enhancing user interactions.
